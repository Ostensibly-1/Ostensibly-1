### Stupidest nerd in the room ü§ì

Since childhood, I've always been interested about how computers work, how softwares and hardwares ran, so on and so fourth. When my parents bought me a computer, I was stoked. It was then at that time that I discovered Windows Batch. I played with it and maybe "borrowed" a few codes from the net, but then I realized, if there are more of this "typing" that makes programs run, why not explore them. That was when I came around with Lua, Lua is such a simple yet fast language, technically it was Luau which was in Roblox because I was a big fan of it back then. I was stoked with how it worked, it introduced to me variables, functions, constants, types of integers, so on. The next language in my mind was JavaScript. I don't know the exact reason but I always found JavaScript really cool, I coded in it, switched back and fourth with TypeScript. All of these happened in a span of 3 years since 2021. I am now seeking for more experiences to develop my passion to become an aspiring developer via GitHub. I am planning to contribute to open-source repositories and upload my personal projects on my profile.

### My Dream üíñ

To become a great developer some day and invent a revolutionary software that helps and benefits people. To teach people and encourage them about computer and software engineering, etc.

### Stupid stupid stuff üëéüèª

I've always made stupid decisions, "borrowing" code was one of them, Funny thing is that I was doxxed at one point because of this. I am now working on a better version of myself and currently working on a private project called "Avalf" \(A VM-based, Advanced Lua Fortifier\), a VM-Based Lua Obfuscator that aims to protect Lua scripts.
